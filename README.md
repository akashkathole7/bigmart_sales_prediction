# bigmart_sales_prediction

Welcome to the world of BigMart Sales Prediction! This repository contains code and resources related to predicting the sales of items sold at BigMart stores. With machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, we can forecast future sales of various products and identify key factors that contribute to higher sales.

The purpose of this project is to provide a starting point for those interested in developing or implementing their own BigMart Sales Prediction models. This project includes sample code and datasets to help individuals get started with building their own models and improve the accuracy of their sales forecasts.

Datasets
This project includes several datasets that can be used to train and test BigMart Sales Prediction models. These datasets are publicly available and contain information about the sales of different items sold at BigMart stores. The datasets also include various attributes such as item weight, item visibility, item type, and store size.

Code
The code included in this project is written in Python and uses popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow. The code provides examples of how to preprocess the data, build and evaluate different BigMart Sales Prediction models, and visualize the output. Additionally, the code includes functions for hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.

Resources
This project includes a list of resources related to sales prediction and forecasting, such as articles, videos, and books. These resources can be helpful for individuals looking to improve their understanding of sales prediction and learn about best practices and industry trends.

Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have suggestions for additional datasets, resources, or code examples, please submit a pull request. Additionally, please report any issues or bugs you encounter while using the code or datasets.
